# Aggregation level for importance sampling weights: 
# token: per-token
# sequence: product over tokens
# geometric: geometric mean
mis_level: "sequence"

# Handling mode for IS weights: 
# truncate: cap to upper bound, TIS
# mask: zero outside [lower, upper], MIS
# clip: clip to [lower, upper], CIS
mis_mode: "truncate"

# For mask or clip mode, the lower bound of the IS weights.
# For truncate mode, it will not be used.
# If not set, it will be set to 1.0 / mis_upper_bound
# Geo should use 0.9999
mis_lower_bound: 0.5

# For truncate, mask, or clip mode, the upper bound of the IS weights
# Geo should use 1.0001
mis_upper_bound: 2.0

# Per-token veto threshold. If any token ratio < this, zero the entire sequence weight, the sequences won't have gradient
# Note: float number must be written with dot e.g. 1.0e-4, not 1e-4
mis_veto_threshold: 1.0e-4
