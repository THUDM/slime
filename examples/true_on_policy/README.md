# True On-Policy between Training and Inference

True on-policy ensures that the log probs generated by inference engine (SGLang) is strictly equal to the one generated by the training Engine.

## Examples

### Example 1

```bash
python examples/true_on_policy/run_simple.py
```

### Example 2

```bash
python scripts/run_qwen3_4b_fsdp.py --true-on-policy
```

## What Expected to Observe

After running the training, you can see in wandb that the metric `train/train_rollout_logprob_abs_diff` should be exactly `0`. This indicates that there is no difference between the log probabilities from the training and the inference.
